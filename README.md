# Word Guessing Game 🎮

This project is a **Word Guessing Game** built using **React** with the **Next.js** framework. The game allows players to guess a secret word by asking yes-or-no questions or making direct guesses. The system provides responses based on the input, similarity scoring, and hints to guide the player. This game mimics a "20 Questions" style where players aim to uncover the hidden word in as few attempts as possible.
